    <br>
    <br>
    
      This project is aboout a tutorial website that teaches HTML & CSS for beginners and essentially, teaches programming online. In this tutorial we will be covering the basic concepts and elements of HTML and CSS, while providing examples. We will also providing a tryout box for beginners to run their codes in. We offer free coding tutorials and reference materials for people who are interested in learning coding. In this project, we show examples, and tryout box for them to practice and complete coding exercises using online editor. Perhaps you will also be able to make your own tutorial website after you have finish completing our  fantastic website tutorial!</p>

	<h2>
		Design Considerations
	</h2>
	</div>
	
		<p class="ttxt">
		


The design of this project was pretty much determined by what we learned in the class and we also add more features on it. The design of this project was based on “Box Theme” designed by Ahmed Essa. However, we changed the preloading animation, layout, colors, and other features. The used of colors are, light grey, light blue, teal, pink, and white. 
	You will see the loading animation when open a new page, and it appears in every pages. We designed a browser tab icon “L” for our page title. The header section, we have a “Let’s Code” logo on the top left corner, when you click it, it will bring you back to the home page. The search bar is placed next to the logo, it’s a Google search engine. When you type in the “Questions?!” text box, it will open a new tab window. On the right it’s a handburg menu, when you open it, it will pop up in the full screen, and we put each category in different columns. We believed this is easier and clear for the user. In the center of the page, there’s text animation shows the title of what’s this page about. There’s a little icon tells you to scroll down the page. We also created the collapsible for the “challenge” part” Just click “+” icon, then it will show what we think about this project and what we overcome with it. When you scroll down, as you can see on the bottom left corner, there’s view count, it will count how many time you reload this website, it will keep the record until you close the window. On the bottom right corner, there’s a small arrow, when you click it, it will bring you back to the top. We also designed a footer and link to our personal site.

		The challenges for the final project were mostly about javascript and jQuery. I was struggling with the preloading animation and the handburger menu. In the beginning, I was thinking to add these new features onto our midterm project. But for some reasons the preloading animation wasn’t able to show up or load when open a new page. Then I found a free website temple “Box Theme” designed by Ahmed Essa, I looked his code and realized that I need to add the javascript and jQuery library in order to load the animation. For the handburger menu, I was struggling about how to make three columns list inside the dropdown menu. So I putted each column in one class, and set the style float left, center ,and right and set the width for 33% so they can fit to the menu. I was also struggling about the search bar and visitor count features too. So I found the Google search API and insert this code <strong>&#60;gcse:searchbox-only newWindow=true&#62;&#60;/gcse:searchbox-only&#62; </strong>and the javascript then it finally works. For the visitor count feature, we were trying to figure out how to keep the visitor visit record. But we found that required more method such as database, IP address ,and software that help us to keep the record. So then we end up this function, and we change the feather to how many times a visitor reload in our website, as you can see on the bottom left corner, it will count how many times you load the page. Overall, this project it’s challenge, but I learned a lot from doing this project step by step. I am really happy for the result.

		For the final project we added a lot of things. we changed the entire design. which now it looked so cool. One of the biggest challenge for me was fixing everything to work with the new style and my codes. I was having a hard time with adding  a check-list to the page. After checking on how i did on one of our assignment I got it to work. Overall we did really well,  the result turned out stunning!

		 The overall challenge for the final was  that there were a lot of adjusting to do when we decided to change the whole look of our webpage. It was not hard, but it was just a little bit more challenging for me personally. I thought of it as a great learning experience and being able to use what we learned onto our webpage. When we finally put it all together, it looked really nice. I felt bad because I spent awhile trying to figure out how to code for my part, and my groupmate Ivory was able to easily help me. I was able to help research on the style that we wanted for our final. I was able to look up a few website that helped sparked the style of website we have now. The changes that we wanted from the website was the animation that loaded when the webpage is first open. I also spent a great deal trying to change my pages to match the new style of our website. My part on the number count took a long time because I could not figure why the numbers would not move.  I felt as if I did not do as much as what I wanted to, but I learned a great deal  while working on the final project.
